### Exercise 17.1 Summary
For the chosen material HgSe (mp-957), the MLIP-predicted bulk modulus (54.6 GPa) is very close to the MP-calculated value (57.0 GPa), showing only a small deviation. This indicates that the ML model provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the mechanical stiffness for this compound.

### Exercise 17.2 Summary
For the chosen Cu(111) surface with an oxygen adsorbate, the computed adsorption energy is −0.424 eV. The negative value indicates that the adsorption process is energetically favorable, meaning O binds stably to the Cu(111) surface. The magnitude of the adsorption energy also suggests moderate interaction strength, consistent with typical chemisorption behavior of oxygen on copper surfaces.
